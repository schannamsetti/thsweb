            <p> I am a general physician working at So-So Hospital. I am more of medical expert than a technology one.
                So,
                when I saw the super intuitive and easy to use platform on TeleHealth Services, I was thrilled! The
                website
                and platform are easy to navigate and easy to use. All of the features of the platform are organized
                well
                and
                overall, it is aesthetically pleasing to look at. My patients also love how easy and efficient the
                platform
                is to use on their end.</p>

            <p> One of my patients has been struggling with osteoarthritis and it was difficult to give her the proper
                treatment she needed, and schedule appointments for her when hospitals were packed with COVID patients.
                However, my hospital implemented TeleHealth Services into our practice and it eased both of our worries!
                I
                was able
                to giver her effective and proper treatment that she would've otherwised received at my office, and she
                has
                been doing so much better since her diagnosis despite being online!

            <p>My children, who are 4 and 10 years old, actually look forward to their appointments. The platform
                TeleHealth
                Services uses has different themes based on who the patient is that is using it. For example, the kids
                platform has a lot of colors and books and online toys in the waiting room feature, and my kids love it!
                My
                husband and I
                are so thankful for this service, and it has helped in this crazy time.

                Luckily, the hospital I work at implemented TeleHeath Services and the platform became super easy to
                still
                continue my learning and help my patients! Thank you so much TeleHealth Services!
