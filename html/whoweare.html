            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Story</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center;">TeleHealth Services was founded in the year of 2020 during the COVID-19
                pandemic when healthcare was difficult to be accessed. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases, which
                in turn leading to the unavailability of doctor's appointments, many doctor visits were
                cancelled. As conditions worsened, it became extremely difficult to even schedule a yearly physical
                examination, not only overwhelming thousands of people but healthcare providers as well. We created
                TeleHealth Services to ease their worries and because we believe everyone should receive the proper
                healthcare they deserve despite any troubling circumstances. Our purpose is to emulate and provide you
                with an efficient way to easily connect with your patients and give them the care that you know they
                deserve. We
                strive to make consultation treatment more easily accessible and widely available for everyone.</p>
